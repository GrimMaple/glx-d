# glx-d

Static bindings to GLX library  
Mostly generated using `dstep`, but manually adjusted to compile and work  
`version(linux)` is added to prevent compilation on Windows  

# Usage
  
To use the library, `import glx.glx;`. All the files are in corresponding modules.  
You can also `import glx;` to import everything at once.
